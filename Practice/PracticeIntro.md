# Machine Learning

The data mining practice focuses on the Machine Learning tecniques.

First of all, an little background on the story of the Information technology.

- '60 Early data collections and databases
- '70 Early databases managment systems
- '80 DBMS maturity and the introduction of multiple type of data along with new access paradigms
- '90 web, data warehousing, knowledge discovery througth databases
- 2000 the explosion of big data

The *Machine Learing* enters into a complex situation with the aim to study and improve the ability of the computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

This can be done by discovering patters in data gathered by the databases.

Inside the Machine learning field, many other are deepen to find the best solution, such as Artificial intelligence, DBMS technology
