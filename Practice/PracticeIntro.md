# Machine Learning

The data mining practice focuses on the Machine Learning tecniques.

First of all, an little background on the story of the Information technology.

- '60 Early data collections and databases
- '70 Early databases managment systems
- '80 DBMS maturity and the introduction of multiple type of data along with new access paradigms
- '90 web, data warehousing, knowledge discovery througth databases
- 2000 the explosion of big data

The *Machine Learing* enters into a complex situation with the aim to study and improve the ability of the computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

The *Data Mining* is a computational process to discover patterns in data, discovery of patters can be performed only if we have a set of large datas stored digitally on a databases.
The *Data Mining* uses concepts and tools from:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learnings
- Statistics
- DBMS

In particular the Data Mining focuses on a data driven approach.

An other big concept is *Data Science*, it is an umbrella term that include all the skills of someone who manages data and it includes all the above.

## Tasks in Data Mining
The possible tasks in data mining are subdivided by the type of output we want to obtain. Data Mining is a process and has different stages, this process can influence the project itself and the software development, creating several good alternatives and well-defined tasks. The need for data from different companies calls for a general knowledge.

- Classification: among the customers which are the one likely to respond to a given offer?
- Regression: given a set of number, how can is possible to estimate another set of number?
- Similarity Matching: identify similar individuals based on the known data about them
- Clustering: creating subgroups of a population based on their similarities
- Co-occurrance: find *association* between different entities according to the transaction in which the appear togheter. 
- Profiling: also called *behavior desciption*, here the population is subdivided into similar behavior.
- Link Analysis and prediction: if representing a population as a graph find the possible new connection between individuals.
- Data reduction: given a big population how is possible to replace it with a reduced one but still representative of the entire population?
- Casual Modeling: understand what are the events or actions which actually influence others.

It is possible to introduce a difference between two methods of mining data: **Supervised and unsupervised**.

The supervised method look for similarities with a defined goal, while the unsupervised method only look for similarities but without a specific target, the difference is in the purpouse.

This is a charateristic of the problem, not a design choise.
