# Machine Learning

The data mining practice focuses on the Machine Learning tecniques.

First of all, an little background on the story of the Information technology.

- '60 Early data collections and databases
- '70 Early databases managment systems
- '80 DBMS maturity and the introduction of multiple type of data along with new access paradigms
- '90 web, data warehousing, knowledge discovery througth databases
- 2000 the explosion of big data

The *Machine Learing* enters into a complex situation with the aim to study and improve the ability of the computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

The *Data Mining* is a computational process to discover patterns in data, discovery of patters can be performed only if we have a set of large datas stored digitally on a databases.
The *Data Mining* uses concepts and tools from:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learnings
- Statistics
- DBMS

In particular the Data Mining focuses on a data driven approach.

An other big concept is *Data Science*, it is an umbrella term that include all the skills of someone who manages data and it includes all the above.
