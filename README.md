# Data Mining Study Repo

In this repo I will write a short resume of the slides from the course Data Mining and Machine Learning held by the Professor Claudio Sartori at the Univertity of Bologna. 

The idea is to divide the course into the theory part and the practice part, the theory part will be simply a collections of notes on the slides, while the second part will be composed by exercises and other useful contents.
