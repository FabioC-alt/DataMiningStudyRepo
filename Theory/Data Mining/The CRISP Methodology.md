# The CRISP Methodology
The Data Mining is not an automatizable process becaus it involves many steps that can be different from case to case and also need to include **complex choices**.

Data mining requires a mix of tools, skills, a good methodology, project managment to support the process and a good process model to manage interactions along the process.

A standardization in the methodology allows for many benefits like: a common reference point for discussion, a common understanding, a basis for good practice and clarity in terms of expectation.

The CRISP (*Cross Industry Standard process for data mining*) is subdivide into 6 main phases:

## Business Understanding

The first phase is **Business Understandin**, and this means to comprehend the scenario and iteratively redefine the problem to better understand it.

## Data Understanding

The subprocess dedicated to the data is the Data Understanding and here we need to find out which data are available and how much is the cost of them.
Along with this process we need to understand if is possible to fork the process into more projects.

The subtask necessary are:
- Collection of initial data
- Description of data
- Exploaration of data
- Verification of data

## Data Preparation

Also may be necessary to perform some transformation on the data before using them and this may include:
- Data Set
- Select Data
- Clean Data
- Construct Data
- Integrate Data
- Format Data

## Modeling

The modelling phase aim to capture the patterns hidden in the data.

## Evaluation

In the evaluation phase, the goal is to obtain rigorous assessment of the result of the data mining process.

Compare different choises on a qualitative and quantitative basis based on the confidence of each used model.

## Deployment

The last phase is the deployment where the result of the DM process are used in software system to obtain some returns of investments
