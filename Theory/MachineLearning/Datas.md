# Data in Machine Learning

The data are caratherized by some qualities such as: the type and the quality.

In order to ease the mining activities the data need to be pre-processed and transformed.

## Data Types
The data types can be subdivided into two macro-categories: the categorical and the numerical.

The allowed transformation in data types are different if the data is categorical or numerical.

## Data Quality
The most present problem in data quality is the **Noise**, the noise is the modification of original value, which can compromise the data itself.

Another problem is the presence of **Missing Values** and **Duplicated Values**.
