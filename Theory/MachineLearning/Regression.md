# Regression
The regression focuses on forecasting continuous values. It is a supervised task, where the **target** is numeric and the goal is to minimize the error of the prediction with respect to the target.

The regresion is charaterized by two main types:
- Linear Regresion: where a data set X with N rows and D column are present and a response vector *y* with N values $y_i$ and w is a D-dimensional vector of coefficients that needs to be learned.

The objective function tends to minimize the error in the regression calculus.
